# Note: Full Outer Join is not supported by MySQL so we have to use left and right join with union in the below solution.

# Write your MySQL query statement below


SELECT employee_id FROM
((SELECT Employees.employee_id
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Salaries ON Employees.employee_id = Salaries.employee_id
where Salaries.salary IS NULL)
UNION
(SELECT Salaries.employee_id
FROM Salaries
LEFT JOIN Employees ON Employees.employee_id = Salaries.employee_id
where Employees.name IS NULL)) temp
ORDER BY employee_id
